## ü§ì About Me

With over 15 years of experience in software development, I've dedicated the past 5 years to frontend development, with a focus on React.

Besides my role as developer, I'm involved in most of the technical decisions, including design, architecture and development of core components, as well as, in activities related to configuration management, continuous integration, support, coaching and training other team members.
